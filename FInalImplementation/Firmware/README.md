# Firmware for Smart Energy Monitor

- Include your final Atmel Studio project that combines work from all team members
  - Make sure to use separate modules, for example uart.c, adc.c, timer1.c, display.c, energycalculations.c, etc.
  - These modules will be copied from your own folders once finalized and validated
