# PCB for Smart Energy Monitor

- Include your final PCB design
  - Git doesnt track Altium files that well, so assign one team member to do the schematic and another to PCB afterwards
  - It may be easier to work on Altium project outside of this Git folder
  - If using Git, make sure team members dont work on the Altium files at the same time to avoid issues
  - It is sufficient to copy-paste final PCB design in to this folder
